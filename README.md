# Stock_Price_Visualization
Stock Price Visualization is a project based on Deep Learning. I have used LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Network) to predict the stock price of Facebook company.  I used this because It processes data passing on information as it propagates forward which is the most import part in stock price prediction. I have used investpy python module to extract the stock price dataset and have divided project in two sections, first the visualization part is done using the dataset and in second LSTM model building is done for prediction.
